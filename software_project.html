This Plague—and who can doubt it?
Dismays me so, I’ve sadly penned
Another book about it.”</center><hr/>

<center><h1>CHAPTER I</h1></center>
<center><h2>THE HAPPIEST YOUNG MAN IN MANHATTAN</h2></center>
<p>To have omnibus tastes and an automobile income—how ironic?</p>
<p>With this reflexion I let myself collapse into a padded chair of transcendent comfort, lit a cigarette
and inspected once more the amazing bank-book. Since I had seen it last several credit entries had been
made—over twenty thousand dollars; and in the meantime, dawdling and dreaming in the woods of
Maine, all I had managed to squander was a paltry thousand. Being a man of imagination I sought for a
simile. As I sat there by the favourite window of my favourite club I could see great snowflakes falling in
the quiet square, and at that moment it seemed to me that I too was standing under a snowfall, a
snowfall of dollars steadily banking me about</p>
<p>For a moment I revelled in the charming vision, then like a flash it changed. Now I could see two
figures locked in Homeric combat. Like a serene over-soul I watched them, I, philosopher, life-critic; for
was not one of them James H. Madden, a man of affairs, the other, J. Horace Madden, dilettante and
dreamer.... Look! from that clutter of stale snow a form springs triumphant. Hurrah! It is the near-poet,
the man on the side of the angels.— And so rejoiced was I at[2] this issue that I regarded the little 
bankbook almost resentfully.</p>
<p>“Figures, figures,” I sighed, “what do you mean to me? Crabbed symbols on a smudgy page! can you
buy for me that fresh Spring-morning feeling in the brain, that rapture of a fine thing finely done? Ah no!
the luxury you spell means care and worry. In comfort is contentment. And am I not content? Nay! in all
Manhattan is there man more happy? Young, famous, free—could life possibly be more charming? And
so in my tower of tranquillity let me work and dream; and every now and then, little book, your totals
will grow absurd, and I will look at you and say: ‘Figures, figures, what do you mean to me?’</p>
<p>“But, after all,” I went on to reflect, “Money is not so utterly a nuisance. Pleasant indeed to think
that when most are pondering over the problem of the permanent meal-ticket, you are yourself well
settled on the sunny side of Easy Street. Poets have piped of Arcady, have chorused of Bohemia, have
expressed their enthusiasm for Elysian fields, but who has come to chant the praise of Easy Street? Yet
surely it is the kindliest of all? Behind its smiling windows are no maddening constraints, no irking
servitudes, no tyranny of time. Just sunshine, laughter, mockery of masters— Oh, a thousand times
blessed, golden, glorious Easy Street!”</p>
<p>Here I lighted a fresh cigarette and settled more snugly in that chair of kingly comfort.</p>
<p>“Behold in me,” I continued lazily, “a being specially favoured of the gods. Born if not with a silver
spoon in my mouth at least with one of a genteel quality of nickel, blest with a boyhood notably
cheering and[3] serene, granted while still in my teens success that others fight for to the grave’s edge,
untouched by a single sorrow, unthwarted by a solitary defeat—does it not seem as if my path in life
had been ever preceded by an Olympian steam roller macadamising the way?</p>
<p>“True, as to appearance, the gods have failed to flatter me. If you, gentle reader, who are as perfect
as the Apollo Belvedere, gaze, at your chiselled features in the silver side of your morning tea-pot, you
will get a good idea of mine. But there—I refer you to a copy of Wisdom for Women, the well-known
feminist Weekly. It contains an illustrated interview, one of that celebrated series, Lions in their Dens.
Harken unto this:</p>
<center>“A tall, tight-lipped young man, eager, yet abstracted; eyes quizzical, mouth a straight line,
brow of a dreamer, chin of a flirtatious stockbroker. His gleaming glasses suggest the journalist, his
prominent nose the tank-town tragedian. Add to that that he has a complexion unæsthetically sanguine,
and that his flaxen hair, receding from his forehead, gives him a fictitious look of intellectuality, and you
have a combination easier to describe than to imagine....”</center>
<p>“What a blessing it is we cannot see ourselves as others see us! How it would fill life with intolerable
veracities! Dear lady who wrote the above, I can forgive you for the Roman nose, for the flirtatious chin,
nay, even for the fictitious intellectuality of my noble brow, but for one thing I can never think of you
with joy. You wrote of me that I was ‘a mould of fashion and a glass of form.’ Since then, alas! I have
been compelled to live up to your description. Bohemian to the backbone, lover of the flannel suit[4] of
freedom and the silken shirt of ease, how I have suffered in such clutch of comme-il-faut no tongue can
tell. Yet thanks to a Fifth Avenue tailor even a little sartorial success has fallen to my lot.”</p>
<p>Success! some men seem to have a magic power of attracting it, and I think I must be one. Sitting
there in the window of the club, as I watched the shadows steal into the square, and the snow thicken
to a fluttering curtain I positively purred with satisfaction. Behind me the silent library was lit only by a
fire of glowing coals. The jocund light gleamed on the carved oak of the book-cases, and each diamond
pane winked jovially. Yet cheerful though it was my thoughts were far more rosy.
But now my reverie was being broken. Two men were approaching, and by their voices I knew them to
be Quince the critic and Vaine the poet. The first was a representative of the School of Suds, the second
an exponent of the School of Sediment; but as neither were included in the number of my more
intimate enemies I did not turn to greet them.
Goring Quince is a stall-fed man with a purple face, cotton-coloured hair and supercilious eyebrows. He
is an incubator of epigrams. His articles are riots of rhetoric, and it is marvellous how completely he can
drown a poor little idea in a vat of verbiage.
Herrick Vaine is a puffy, pimply person, with a mincing manner and an emasculated voice. He might
have been a poet of note but for two things: while reading his work you always have a feeling that you
have seen something oddly like it before; and after you have read it all you retain is a certain darkbrown 
taste on the mental palate. Otherwise he is all right.</p>
<p>And now, having described the principals, let me record the little dialogue to which I was the unseen
listener.</p>
<center>Vaine (with elaborate carelessness): By the way, you haven’t read my latest book, I suppose?
Quince (cooingly): Why yes, my boy. I lost no time in reading it. I positively wallowed—I mean revelled in
it. Reminds me of Baudelaire in spots. Without you and a chosen few what would literature be?
Vaine (enraptured): How lovely of you to say so. You know I value your opinion more than any in the
world.
Quince (waving his gold-rimmed eyeglasses): Not at all. Merely my duty as a watchdog of letters. Yes, I
thought your Songs Saturnalian in a class by itself; but now I can say without being accused of a lapse of
literary judgment that your Poems Plutonian marks a distinct epoch in modern poetry. There is an
undefinable something in your work, a je ne sais quoi ... you know.
Vaine: Yes; thank you, thank you.
Quince: Is it selling, by the way?
Vaine: Thank heaven, no! How banal! Popular success would imply artistic failure. To the public true art
must always be inaccessible. If ever I find my work becoming bourgeois, it will be because I have
committed artistic suicide. On my bended knees I pray to be delivered from popularity.
Quince: I see. You prefer the award of posterity[6] to the reward of prosperity. Well, no doubt time will
bring you your meed of recognition. In the meantime give me a copy of the poems, and I will review it in
next week’s Compass.
Vaine: Will you indeed. That honour alone will repay me for writing it. By the way, I imagine I saw a copy
in the library. Let me look.
(As Vaine had put it there himself his doubt seemed a little superfluous. He switched on a light, and from
the ranked preciosity of a certain shelf he selected a slim, gilt volume.)
Vaine: Poems Plutonian.
Quince (taking it in his fat, soft hands): How utterly exquisite! What charming generosity of margin!
Vaine: Yes; you know the great fault of books, to my mind, is that they contain printed matter. Some day
I dream of writing a book that shall be nearly all margin, a book from which the crudely obvious shall be
eliminated, a book of exquisite intrusion, of supreme suggestion, where magic words like rosaries of
pearls shall glimmer down the pages. I really think that books are the curse of literature. If every writer
were compelled to grave his works on brass and copper from how much that is vain and vapid would we
not be delivered?
Quince: Ah, yes! Still books have their advantages. Here, for example, am I going to burn the incense of
a cigar before the putrescent—I mean the iridescent altar of art. Now if[7] Poems Plutonian were
inscribed on brass or stone I confess I should hesitate. What are those things?
(He pointed to a separate shelf, on which stood nine volumes with somewhat aggressive covers.)
Vaine: Well may you ask. Brazen strumpets who have stumbled into the temple of Apollo. These, my
dear sir, are the so-called novels of Norman Dane. You see, as a member of the club, he is supposed to
give the library a copy of his books. We all hoped he wouldn’t, but he came egregiously forward. Of
course we couldn’t refuse the monstrous things.
Quince: No, I understand. What’s this? The Yellow Streak: Two hundred thousand! The Dipsomaniac:
Sixth Edition!! Rattlesnake Ranch: Tenth Impression!!! Why, what a disgusting lot of money the man
must be making!
Vaine: Yes, the Indiana Idol, the Boy Bestsellermonger. A perfect bounder as regards Art. But he knows
how to truckle to the mob. His books sell by the ton. They’re so bad, they’re almost good.
Quince (with surprising feeling): There! I don’t agree with you. He doesn’t even know how to please the
public. It takes a clever man to do that, and Norman Dane is only a dry-goods clerk spoiled. No, the point
is—he is the public, the apotheosis of the vulgar intelligence. Don’t think for a moment he is writing[8]
down to the level of the mob. He charms the great half-educated because he himself belongs to them.
He can’t help it.
Vaine: Yes, but there are so many plebeian novelists. How do you account for Dane’s spectacular
success?
Quince: A fool’s luck! He happened to hit the psychological moment. When he leaped into the lists with
The Haunted Taxicab taxis had just come out, and at the same moment there was a mania for mystery
stories. Take two popular motifs, mix recklessly, spice with sentiment and sauce with sensation—there
you have the recipé of a best-seller. His book fluked into favour. His publishers put their weight behind
it. In a month he found himself famous from Maine to Mexico. But he couldn’t do it again; no, not in a
thousand years. What has he done since? Live on his name. Step cunningly in his tracks. Bah! I tell you
Norman Dane’s an upstart, a faker; to the very heart of him a shallow, ignorant pretender....</center>
